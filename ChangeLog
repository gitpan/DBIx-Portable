	* Release 0.01.
	
	* This is the initial release.  It contains only documentation, and all of 
	that is in the file Portable.pm.  This documentation isn't complete, but it 
	should be enough for a first version, and I am keeping strictly to a Jan 5 
	release date regardless of completeness.

	* Began creating this new Perl distribution package for CPAN, using an 
	initial title of DBIx-Portable-0.01, including ReadMe and ChangeLog files.

	* Began development on these modules as their own entity that is separate
	from the application, which will be distributed open-source on CPAN, using
	initial titles of DBIx::Portable and DBIx::Portable::*.  The modules are to
	comprise an RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.  This
	development effort was discussed with the victoria.pm Perl Mongers group.
	
	* Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

	* Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which added
	an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for each page
	request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl code.

	* Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
	self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema, user
	interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost completely
	rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules for database
	communication and the web interface logic, with MySQL-specific code and
	database generic or data dictionary code in separate files, and separate
	files for parts of the web interface.  The program used the same generic
	CPAN modules as in the first prototype, DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

	* Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

	* Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
	self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross between
	a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical or
	genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes of code
	that ended up in these modules. All of this application's code, for
	database communication and web interface logic, was situated in a single
	module, with the rest of the program being more generic CPAN modules like
	DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

	* Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have something to
	start developing, testing and deploying database driven applications on.
